          "Lexusâ€™ 2023 RX lineup gets its first complete redo since 2016, including an evolutionary exterior refresh and a complete rethinking of the interior. The redesign also makes room for the first-ever plug-in hybrid version, the RX 450h+, which we will review closer to its debut later in the model year. These welcome changes should help keep the RX firmly ensconced atop the heap in the ever-growing, super-competitive midsize premium crossover segment, where it faces off with worthy rivals including the Acura MDX, Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Audi Q7, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Lincoln Nautilus, Mercedes-Benz GLE, and Volvo XC90. What the top-selling RX has going for it is that it leaves the niches to the other guys and offers shoppers a quiet, comfortable, well-equipped cabin, decent handling and power, a luxury-car ride, contemporary good looks, and the promise of Lexus quality and reliability.",
